# Deeper Testing

This workshop offers a number of smaller sections to consider how we can take our automated testing beyond just that of unit & integration tests.

Feel free to choose a different path through the exercises, but we recommend the following order; each link contains some more specific instructions.

## Requirements

This workshop assumes you have a recent version of node/npm installed. If not, you can install those [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> Note that since we will be triggering a browser session from the command line in various exercises, WSL on Windows will not be an option.

## Exercises

> Each exercise is configured as a separate codebase so if you want VSCode to correctly handle intellisense etc., it is best to open each subfolder directly in VSCode during that exercise.

Part 1 - End to End testing:
* [Selenium](./e2e-selenium/Readme.md)
* [Playwright](./playwright/Readme.md)

Part 2 - Performance & Load Testing
* [Artillery](./artillery/Readme.md)

Part 3 - Performance & Accessibility testing
* [Google Lighthouse](./lighthouse/Readme.md)

Part 4 (Optional) - Security Testing
* [OWASP ZAP](./zap/Readme.md)

## Part 5 (Optional) - Use the tools in anger!

If you have time after exploring each of the tools, have a go at setting them up fresh for your Project Exercise codebase (or indeed, for a work project). What useful tests can you generate?
